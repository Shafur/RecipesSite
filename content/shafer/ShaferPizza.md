# The Shafer Pizza


### The Dough
#### Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups warm water
- 1/4 cups sugar
- 3 tsp. instant yeast
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp. salt

#### Instructions

- In the stand mixer bowl, combine the water, sugar, and yeast. Allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes until frothy. Add in vegetable oil.
- In a large bowl mix the flour and salt. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture 1/2 cup at a time. Mix well between additions (using dough attachment). Continue adding flour mixture until dough can be pulled away from the sides of the bowl with a spatula. (Dough will be quite sticky).
- Grease a large bowl, then scrape the dough into the bowl. Turn the dough to coat it in oil. Cover the tough with plastic wrap or a towel and let rise at room temp. until doubled (about 1 hour).
- Turn dough out onto well-floured work surface. Pull the dough around to the bottom, stretching it to create a smooth ball. Cut it into 3 equal portions. Each ball will be approximately 1 lb.
- Roll out dough for pizza or freeze leftovers.
