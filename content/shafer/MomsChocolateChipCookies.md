# Mom's Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt (Redmonds Real Salt)
- 2 Sticks room temperature butter
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon of my vanilla
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup walnut pieces (optional)


### Instructions

- In your kitchen aid mixer, mix butter and sugar together then add eggs and vanilla and mix until incorporated.

- In a separate bowl, add flour, baking soda, salt, chocolate chips, and walnuts. Mix with a whisk or spoon.

- Add Dry ingredients to stand mixer slowly or put it all in and use the kitchen aid guard so flour doesn't fly everywhere.

- Mix just until incorporated. I use a small scooper to put on baking sheet but you could use a teaspoon (Kris recommends a tablespoon)

- Bake at *375 for 9-11 minutes or until slightly browned. Remove from baking sheet and place directly onto counter top to cool.



### Additional Notes

- Mom uses her homemade vanilla and good quality chocolate chips. She also uses good quality salt and unbleached organic flour.
- Don't over bake them, and quickly put them onto the counter to cool.
- Keep them in an airtight container when fully cooled.
