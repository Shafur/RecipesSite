# Pico De Gallo

### Ingredients
- 1 cup finely chopped white onion (about 1 small onion)
- 1 medium jalepeno or serrano pepper, ribs and seeds removed, finely chopped (decrease or omit if sensitive to spice, or add another if you love heat)
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste
- 1 1/2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes (about 8 small or 4 large), chopped
- 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (about 1 bunch)

### Instructions
- In a medium serving bowl, combine the chopped onion, jalepno, lime juice and salt. Let it marinate for about 5 minutes while you chop the tomatoes and cilantro.
- Add the chopped tomatoes and cilantro to the bowl and stir to combine. Taste, and add more salt if the flavors don't quite sing.
- For the best flavor, let the mixture marinate for 15 minutes or several hours in the refrigerator. Serve as a dip, or with a slotted spoon or large serving fork to avoid transferring too much watery tomatoe juice with your pico. Pico de gallo keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.
